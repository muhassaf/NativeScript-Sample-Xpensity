## Running the sample

1. Make sure you have the [NativeScript Command Line Interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript) installed as well as all the prerequisites for the NativeScript development, described in the [installation guide](https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/quick-setup#the-nativescript-cli).
2. Clone the repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Xpensity.git
    cd sample-Xpensity
    ```
3. Run the project:

    `tns run ios|android [--emulator]`

    The `--emulator` keyword instructs the CLI to load the iOS simulator or an android emulator depending on the platform you want.
4. Use the test account to use the app with predefined data or create your own.
